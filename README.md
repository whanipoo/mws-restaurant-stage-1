A project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Eva "Pornubpan" Sims.

## Getting Started
1. Download the file or clone the repository from  [HERE](https://github.com/whanipoo/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
2. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
